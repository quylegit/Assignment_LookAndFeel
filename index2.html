        <h1>Top 6 Dividend Stocks for 2019 </h1>
        <p id="main-topic"> Dependable dividend stocks that routinely grow their payouts are welcome in any environment. But they seem especially attractive nowadays.</p>
        <p>
            Stock market volatility is back with a vengeance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went from powering ahead to an all-time high of 26,828 on Oct. 3 to losing 8%
            in the span of about three weeks. These kinds of rocky markets tend to give investors motion sickness. But they can add a dose of Dramamine to their portfolios - in the form
            of reliable dividend-growth stocks.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Dividend growers, which tend to be quality companies, have generally shown greater resilience in unsteady markets and could address concerns about dividend stocks
            in a rising-rate environment," write Tianyin Cheng, director of strategy and ESG Indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices; and Vinit Srivastava, head of strategy and ESG indices
            at S&P Dow Jones Indices."This argument applies to not only to the U.S. large-cap space, but it also extends to small- and mid-cap segments and international markets."
        </p>

        <p>
            Dividend stocks - with long track records of rock-solid rising payments tend to generate superior returns over long periods of time and can help investors
            weather shorter periods of market turbulence.
        </p>

                <h2>AT&T</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>MARKET VALUE: $$211.5 billion</li>
                    <li>DIVIDEND YIELD: 6.9% </li>
                    <li>COUNTRY: United States</li>
                    <li>CONSECUTIVE ANNUAL DIVIDEND INCREASES: 34 </li>

                <p>
                    Telecommunications stocks are synonymous with dividend payments. Customers pay for service every month, which ensures a steady stream of cash to fund dividends.
                    AT&T (T, $29.09) - the largest U.S. telecom company - is a perfect example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AT&T has raised its dividend on an annual basis for 34 consecutive years, and typically boasts one of the highest dividend yields in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
                    That's in large part because of the cash flows generated by the telecom business, which enjoys what some call an effective duopoly with rival Verizon (VZ).
                    Together, the pair command roughly 70% of the U.S. wireless subscriptions market.

                <ul>
                    <li>MARKET VALUE: $213.7  billion</li>
                    <li>DIVIDEND YIELD: 4.0%</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Chevron (CVX, $111.53) is an integrated oil giant that also has operations in natural gas and geothermal energy. And like its competitors,
                    Chevron hurt when oil prices started to tumble in 2014. The energy major was forced to slash spending as a result, but - reassuringly - it never slashed its dividend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cut to today, and the outlook for oil looks much more stable. Oil prices topped $75 per barrel in early October. Kiplinger forecasts that prices will range
                    from $65 to $70 a barrel through the end of the year - a far better environment than what energy companies were dealing with a few years ago.With three decades of
                    uninterrupted dividend growth under its belt, Chevron's track record instills confidence that the payouts will continue.

                    <li>MARKET VALUE: $195.2 billion</li>
                    <li>DIVIDEND YIELD: 3.4%</li>

                <p>
                    Coca-Cola (KO, $45.92) has long been known for quenching consumers' thirst, but it's equally effective at quenching investors' thirst for income.
                    The company has paid a quarterly dividend since 1920, and that dividend has increased annually for the past 55 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the U.S. market for carbonated beverages on the decline for more than a decade, according to market research, Coca-Cola has responded by adding bottled water,
                    fruit juices and teas to its product lineup to keep the cash flowing. In addition to the namesake Coca-Cola brand, KO also sports names such as Minute Maid,
                    Powerade, Simply Orange and Vitaminwater.

                    A descendant of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, today's Exxon Mobil (XOM, $77.53) remains one of the world's largest oil companies and is
                    the single biggest company by market value among Standard & Poor's 53 Dividend Aristocrats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a dividend stalwart - Exxon and its various predecessors have strung together uninterrupted payouts since 1882 –
                    it continued to hike its payout even as oil prices declined in recent years. Exxon has increased its dividend for 36 consecutive years,
                    and has done so at an average annual rate of 6.3%. That includes a 7% boost to its quarterly checks announced in late April.

                <p>
                    Kimberly-Clark's (KMB, $102.31) well-known brands include Huggies diapers, Scott paper towels and Kleenex tissues. Like other makers of consumer staples,
                    Kimberly-Clark holds out the promise of delivering slow but steady growth along with a healthy dividend to drive total returns. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters
                    expect earnings to grow at an average annual rate of 4.8% over the next five years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kimberly-Clark has paid out a dividend for 83 consecutive years, and has raised the annual payout for the past 46 years.

                    Like Coca-Cola (KO), PepsiCo (PEP, $110.45) is working against a long-term slide in soda sales. It too has responded by expanding its offerings of non-carbonated beverages.
                    One advantage Pepsi has that Coca-Cola doesn't is its foods business - the company owns Frito-Lay snacks like Doritos, Tostitos and Rold Gold pretzels, and demand for salty
                    snacks remains solid.
                </p>
                <p> In August, the company struck a deal to acquire at-home carbonated drink maker SodaStream (SODA) for $3.2 billion.</p>
                <p> Pepsi has paid out a quarterly dividend ever since 1965, and the company has raised the annual payout for 46 consecutive years.</p>
