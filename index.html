                With economic fundamentals now weakening significantly and pointing to just 1.5% GDP growth in the first half of 2019 (half 2018's growth rate) valuation becomes more important than ever for putting new money to work.

                It can feel overwhelming, but don't let that stop you, because you really can do it. Start today. Here's how:
            </p>

        <!--Section 1-->
        <div class="row">

            <div class="col-12 col-s-12 cards">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-4 col-s-12 ">

                        <h2>Start Now</h2>
                        <p>
                            Do not wait until next month, because that becomes next year, and so on - until your child is 14
                            and you realize you simply may not have enough time to build a substantial fund for them.
                            Procrastination is a powerful, insidious human tendency, and you need to commit to beginning this journey immediately.
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-4 col-s-12 ">

                        <h2>Start Small</h2>
                        <p>
                            Setting aside just $15 a month is a great start when you're in the early days of parenthood.
                            Even if you're only using a savings account, the key is to automate the process so that you are routinely depositing that $15 every single month.
                            While it may seem small, putting away $15 on a monthly basis into an account with 1.00% interest will yield $3,569.21 in 18 years.
                            Invest in a manner that generates a 5% return, and that number grows to $5,839. Scale up the monthly contribution each year, and the number grows exponentially.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Scale Up</h2>
                        <p>
                            Within the first six months of your child's life, you should decide
                            what type of dedicated account you will use for college funding over the remainder of his or her formative years. These are your primary options:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-4 col-s-12">
                        <h2>529 Plans</h2>

                        <p>
                            Accounts that provide tax-free growth when the dollars are used for educational expenses, whether it be college or a private grade school/high school.
                            The contributions go into the account after tax, but earnings accrue tax-free. Your individual state may also provide a tax break through a sponsored plan.
                            It's a compelling and effective way to save. However, 529s do not come without caveats. If the child chooses not to go to school, the account can be changed
                            to another family member and used properly. If the account is used for non-educational expenses, the earnings are taxed and you could be susceptible to an IRS
                            and state penalty, as well.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-4 col-s-12">
                        <h2>Custodial Accounts</h2>
                        <p>
                            A brokerage account opened by a parent (or grandparent) in which money is invested to provide long-term growth for the period until college.
                            These accounts provide greater flexibility than 529 plans and can be used for any expense to benefit the child. The parent is simply funding the account,
                            making decisions on how it is invested, and then taking out proceeds as needed to support their child - everything from college to new shoes to a car.
                            Keep in mind, though, that when the child reaches the age of majority (depending on the state, age 18 to 21), he or she then technically "owns" the account
                            and can do whatever they want with it. There are some tax advantages with a custodial account, but not nearly as favorable as with a 529 plan.
                            For example, the first $1,050 of earnings in a custodial account are tax free, and the next $1,050 is taxed at the child's tax rate (usually $0).
                            Earnings beyond that $2,100 per year, however, are taxed at the parent's tax rate, so amassing significant assets in a custodial account can lead to tax pain
                            for the custodian.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Roth IRAs</h2>

                        <p>
                            Some parents hedge their bets. What if Junior decides not to go to college? What if he decides to surf in Oahu after high school instead?
                            A Roth IRA funded over the formative years can be tapped to assist with college, but if that doesn't happen, it is there for the parents' retirement.
                            Contributions to the Roth can be taken out tax- and penalty-free at any time for any reason. Any earnings that are used for college expenses can avoid IRS penalty as well,
                            but they would be taxed as income. Earnings can come out tax-free once the Roth owner (the parent) is over 59.
