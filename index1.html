            <h1>In A Weakening Economy Undervalued Quality Dividend Stocks Are The Best Place To Put New Money To Work</h1>
            <p>With economic fundamentals now weakening significantly and pointing to just 1.5% GDP growth in the first half of 2019 (half 2018's growth rate) valuation becomes more important than ever for putting new money to work.</p>
            <p>
                With the S&P 500 up 10% YTD and now historically fairly valued (based on forward PE) buying quality undervalued dividend growth stocks is one of the best strategies you can use.

                The key is to have the right watchlists to know what's worth buying at any given time. I'm fortunate to build and maintain such watchlists as part of my career as a value-focused income growth investment analyst.

                This weekly watchlist series is designed to be a tool to give you solid investing ideas, so you can always know what's the best place to put your hard earned money to work at any given time. Specifically in companies with high margins of safety that have less to fall in a market correction, and which are all coiled springs that are likely to deliver outsized total returns if their valuations return to historical levels.

                To paraphrase a famous Latin quote (Fortuna Eruditis Favet "fortune favors the prepared mind")
            </p>
            <blockquote>"Fortune favors the prepared investor, and so disciplined investors prepared with quality watchlists and high savings will eventually make a fortune."</blockquote>

            <h2>The Best Dividend Growth Stocks You Can Buy Today</h2>
            <p>
                This group of dividend growth blue-chips represents what I consider the best stocks you can buy today. They are presented in five categories, sorted by most undervalued (based on dividend yield theory using a five-year average yield).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>High yield (4+% yield)</li>
                <li>Fast dividend growth</li>
                <li>Dividend Aristocrats</li>
                <li>Dividend Kings</li>
                <li>My Bear Market Buy List (my master watchlist of quality dividend stocks worth owning)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the purposes of these valuation-adjusted total return potentials, I use the Gordon Dividend Growth Model, or GDGM (which is what Brookfield Asset Management uses). Since 1956, this has proven relatively accurate at modeling long-term total returns via the formula: Yield + Dividend growth. That's because, assuming no change in valuation, a stable business model (doesn't change much over time) and a constant payout ratio, dividend growth tracks cash flow growth.</p>
            <p>The valuation adjustment assumes that a stock's yield will revert to its historical norm within 10 years (over that time period, stock prices are purely a function of fundamentals). Thus, these valuation total return models are based on the formula: Yield + Projected 10-year dividend growth (analyst consensus, confirmed by historical growth rate) + 10-year yield reversion return boost.</p>
            <p>For example, if a stock with a historical average yield of 2% is trading at 3%, then the yield is 50% above its historical yield. This implies the stock is (3% current yield - 2% historical yield)/3% current yield = 33% undervalued. If the stock mean-reverts over 10 years, then this means the price will rise by 50% over 10 years just to correct the undervaluation.</p>
            <p>That represents a 4.1% annual total return just from valuation mean regression. If the stock grows its cash flow (and dividend) at 10% over this time, then the total return one would expect from this stock would be 3% yield + 10% dividend (and FCF/share) growth + 4.1% valuation boost = 17.1%.</p>
            <p>The historical margin of error for this valuation-adjusted model is about 20% (the most accurate I've yet discovered).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-4 col-s-4">
            <h2>Discounted Cash Flow</h2>
            <p>
                Fundamentally, any company is worth the present value of all its future cash flow. That's as basic a valuation method as you can get. However, in reality, the future is uncertain, and the discount rate you use, as well your growth assumptions, can make a DCF model say pretty much anything you want.
            </p>
            <p>This is why I consider Morningstar's 100% long-term, fundamentals-driven and conservative analysts to be a great source of DCF estimated fair values.</p>
            <p>Those analysts generally assume slower growth than the analyst consensus and even sometimes management itself. As a result, Morningstar four and five star rated companies can be thought of as "strong buy" or "very strong buy" recommendations, respectively, from analysts whom I consider among the best in the business.</p>
            <p>Above you can see the top-rated companies that my Deep Value Dividend Growth portfolio owns. Every company presented here is one that my own long-term, valuation-adjusted total return model (based on the one Brookfield Asset Management has been using for decades) expects to generate at least 13% long-term total returns (margin of error 20%).</p>
            <p>Note that only the companies with "5-star prices" are ones that Morningstar has done a deep dive on. The "Q" rated companies are merely compared to their peer groups, and thus, not necessarily as reliable.</p>
            <p>But DCF is far from the only valuation method you should consider.</p>

        <div class="col-4 col-s-4">
            <h2>Price-To-Earnings</h2>
            <p>
                Remember that Yale valuation study that looked at stocks based on P/E ratio? Well, the venerable P/E ratio is one of the most popular valuation approaches, and for good reason. While no valuation method is perfect, a good rule of thumb (from Chuck Carnevale, the SA king of value investing and founder of F.A.S.T Graphs) is to never pay more than 15 times forward earnings for a company.
            </p>
            <p>Chuck usually compares companies to their historical P/E ratios, and he's ranked in the top 1.4% of all analysts tracked by TipRanks (based on the forward 12-month total returns of his recommendations). While 12 months is hardly "long term," the point is that Mr. Carnevale is a fantastic value investing analyst, and so, his rule of thumb is well worth keeping in mind.</p>
            <p>
                Here's DVDGP's portfolio holdings that have forward PEs of 15 or less.
            </p>
            <p>Note that stewardship rating is Morningstar's estimate of the quality of the management team. P = poor (DVDGP's policy is to avoid all such companies), S = standard (average to good), and E = exemplary (very good to excellent).</p>
            <p>But while both DCF and forward P/E are great methods to value a company, personally my absolute favorite, and what I use to invest my own money and make most of my recommendations, is Dividend Yield Theory, or DYT. This is how I create my five watchlists, which I intend to use to invest all my savings for the rest of my life.</p>
