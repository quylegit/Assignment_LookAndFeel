            <p>Investing: The act of committing money or capital to an endeavor with the expectation of obtaining an additional income or profit.
			Legendary investor Warren Buffett defines investing as “… the process of laying out money now to receive more money in the future.” 
			The goal of investing is to put your money to work in one or more types of investment vehicles in the hopes of growing your money over time.</p>

			<h2>What is Investing?</h2>
            <p>
                Investing is really about “working smarter and not harder.” Most of us work hard at our jobs, whether for a company or our own business.
				We often work long hours, which requires sacrifice and adds stress. Taking some of our hard-earned money and investing for our future needs is a way 
				to make the most of what we earn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Investing is also about making priorities for your money. Spending is easy and gives instant gratification—whether the splurge is on a new outfit, 
				a vacation to some exotic spot or dinner in a fancy restaurant. All of these are wonderful and make life more enjoyable. But investing requires prioritizing 
				our financial futures over our present desires.Investing is a way to set aside money while you are busy with life and have that money work for you so that you c
				an fully reap the rewards of your labor in the future. Investing is a means to a happier ending.
            </p>
			<strong>Investing Vehicles</strong>
				<p>
				There are many different ways you can go about investing, including putting money into stocks/dividend stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, real estate 
				(and other alternative investment vehicles), or even starting your own business.Every investment vehicle has its positives and negatives.Understanding how 
				different types of investment vehicles work is critical to your success. For example, what does a mutual fund invest in? Who is managing the fund? 
				What are the fees and expenses? Are there any costs or penalties for accessing your money? These are all questions that should be answered before making an investment.
				While it is true there are no guarantees of making money, some work on your part can increase your odds of being a successful investor. Analysis, 
				research and even just reading up on investing can all help.Now that you have a general idea of what investing is and why you should do it, 
				it's time to learn about how investing lets you take advantage of one of the miracles of mathematics: compound interest.

             	<h2>The Concept of Compounding</h2>
                    <p>
                        Compounding is the process of generating more return on an asset's reinvested earnings. To work, it requires two things: the reinvestment of earnings and time. 
						Compound interest can help your initial investment grow exponentially. For younger investors, it is the greatest investing tool possible, and the #1 argument for 
						starting as early as possible. Below we give a couple of examples of compound interest.
                    </p>
				</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Example #1: Apple stock</strong>
				<p>
				An investment of $10,000 in the stock of Apple (AAPL) that was made on December 31, 1980 would have grown to $2,709,248 as of the market’s close on February 28, 2017 
				according to Morningstar’s Advisor Workstation tool. This translates to an annual return of 16.75%, including the reinvestment of all dividends from the stock.Apple started 
				paying dividends in 2012. Even so, if those dividends hadn’t been reinvested the ending balance of this investment would have been $2,247,949 or 83% of the amount that you 
				would have had by reinvesting.While Apple is one of the most successful companies, and their stock is a winner year-in and year-out, compound interest also works for index funds,
				which are managed to replicate the performance of a major market index such as the S&P 500.
				</p>
				</li>
					<li>
					<strong>Example #2: Vanguard 500 Index</strong>
					<p>
					Another example of the benefits of compounding is the popular Vanguard 500 Index fund (VFINX) held for the 20 years ending February 28, 2017.
					A $10,000 investment into the fund made on February 28, 1997 would have grown to a value of $42,650 at the end of the 20-year period. 
					This assumes the reinvestment of all fund distributions for dividends, interest or capital gains back into the fund.Without reinvesting the distributions,
					the value of the initial $10,000 investment would have grown to $29,548 or 69% of the amount with reinvestment.In this and the Apple example, current year
					taxes would have been due on any fund distributions or stock dividends if the investment was held in a taxable account, but for most investors, these earnings 
					can grow tax-deferred in a retirement account such as a employer-sponsored 401(k).
					</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<strong>Starting Early</strong>
					<p>
					Another way to look at the power of compounding is to compare how much less initial investment you need if you start early to reach the same goal.A 
					25-year-old who wishes to accumulate $1 million by age 60 would need to invest $880.21 each month assuming a constant return of 5%.A 35-year-old wishing 
					to accumulate $1 million by age 60 would need to invest $1,679.23 each month using the same assumptions.A 45-year-old would need to invest $3,741.27 
					each month to accumulate the same $1 million by age 60. That’s almost 4 times the amount that the 25-year old needs. Starting early is especially helpful 
					when saving for retirement, when putting aside a little bit early in your career can reap great benefits.

				<h2>Types Of Investments</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many types of investments and investing styles to choose from. Mutual funds, ETFs, individual stocks and bonds, closed-end mutual funds, 
						real estate, various alternative investments and owning all or part of a business are just a few examples.
                    </p>
					</div>
					  <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Stocks:</strong>
                            <p>
                                Buying shares of stock gives the buyer the opportunity to participate in the company’s success via increases in the stock’s price and dividends 
								that the company might declare. Shareholders have a claim on the company’s assets in the event of liquidation, but do not own the assets.Holders of 
								common stock have voting rights at shareholders’ meetings and the right to receive dividends if they are declared. Holders of preferred stock don’t 
								have voting rights, but do receive preference in terms of the payment of any dividends over common shareholders. They also have a higher claim on 
								company assets than holders of common stock.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Bonds:</strong>
                            <p>
                                Bonds are debt instruments whereby an investor effectively is loaning money to a company or agency (the issuer) in exchange for periodic 
								interest payments plus the return of the bond’s face amount when the bond matures. Bonds are issued by corporations, the federal government plus 
								many states, municipalities and governmental agencies.A typical corporate bond might have a face value of $1,000 and pay interest semi-annually. 
								Interest on these bonds are fully taxable, but interest on municipal bonds is exempt from federal taxes and may be exempt from state taxes for 
								residents of the issuing state. Interest on Treasuries are taxed at the federal level only.Bonds can be purchased as new offerings or on the 
								secondary market, just like stocks. A bond’s value can rise and fall based on a number of factors, the most important being the direction of 
								interest rates. Bond prices move inversely with the direction of interest rates.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mutual funds:</strong>

                            <p>
                                A mutual fund is a pooled investment vehicle managed by an investment manager that allows investors to have their money invested in stocks, 
								bonds or other investment vehicles as stated in the fund’s prospectus.Mutual funds are valued at the end of trading day and any transactions to 
								buy or sell shares are executed after the market close as well.Mutual funds can passively track stock or bond market indexes such as the S&P 500, 
								the Barclay’s Aggregate Bond Index and many others. Other mutual funds are actively managed where the manager actively selects the stocks, bonds or 
								other investments held by the fund. Actively managed mutual funds are generally more costly to own. A fund’s underlying expenses serve to reduce 
								the net investment returns to the mutual fund shareholders.Mutual funds can make distributions in the form of dividends, interest and capital gains. 
								These distributions will be taxable if held in a non-retirement account. Selling a mutual fund can result in a gain or loss on the investment, 
								just as with individual stocks or bonds.Mutual funds allow small investors to instantly buy diversified exposure to a number of investment 
								holdings within the fund’s investment objective. For instance, a foreign stock mutual might hold 50 or 100 or more different foreign stocks in 
								the portfolio. An initial investment as low as $1,000 (or less in some cases) might allow an investor to own all the underlying holdings of the fund.
								Mutual funds are a great way for investors large and small to achieve a level of instant diversification.

                            <strong>ETFs:</strong>

                            <p>
                                ETFs or exchange-traded funds are like mutual funds in many respects, but are traded on the stock exchange during the trading day just like 
								shares of stock. Unlike mutual funds which are valued at the end of each trading day, ETFs are valued constantly while the markets are open.Many 
								ETFs track passive market indexes like the S&P 500, the Barclay’s Aggregate Bond Index, and the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks and many 
								others.In recent years, actively managed ETFs have come into being, as have so-called smart beta ETFs which create indexes based on “factors” 
								such as quality, low volatility and momentum.

                            <strong>Alternative investments:</strong>

                            <p>
                                Beyond stocks, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs, there are many other ways to invest. We will discuss a few of these here.Real estate investments 
								can be made by buying a commercial or residential property directly. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) pool investor’s money and purchase 
								properties. REITS are traded like stocks. There are mutual funds and ETFs that invest in REITs as well.Hedge funds and private equity also fall 
								into the category of alternative investments, although they are only open to those who meet the income and net worth requirements of being an 
								accredited investor. Hedge funds may invest almost anywhere and may hold up better than conventional investment vehicles in turbulent markets.
								Private equity allows companies to raise capital without going public. There are also private real estate funds that offer shares to investors 
								in a pool of properties. Often alternatives have restrictions in terms of how often investors can have access to their money.In recent years, 
								alternative strategies have been introduced in mutual fund and ETF formats, allowing for lower minimum investments and great liquidity for investors.
								These vehicles are known as liquid alternatives.
